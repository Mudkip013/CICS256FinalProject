NIKO is a walking, talking desk buddy robot was our final project for the course "CICS256: MAKE: A Hands-On Introduction to Physical Computing".

He takes gesture and voice prompts and has distance-sensing capability to prevent himself from falling off of edges and from walking into obstacles. He is also equipped with LCD displays that change with his current state of operation.
